server.js:

* Use ES6+ syntax, like const, let, arrow functions, and template literals. 
* Use the async/await pattern with try/catch blocks for better error handling and readability.
* Modularize your code by separating API route handlers into different files.
* Use the Express Router to better organize and manage your routes.
* Consider using an ORM like Sequelize or TypeORM for better database management.


EventFormModal.js:

* Consider using React Hook Form or Formik for managing form state and validation.
* Use functional updates for useState hook when the new state depends on the previous state.
* Create a custom SelectCategory component for the category selection part to reduce complexity.
* Use the format function from a library like date-fns or Moment.js for date formatting.


App.js:

* Use functional components and hooks instead of class components.
* Remove the constructor and use useState and useEffect hooks for managing state and side effects.
* Use the async/await pattern with try/catch blocks when fetching data from the API.
* Break down the component into smaller, more focused components to improve readability and maintainability.
* Consider using a state management library like Redux or MobX for managing application state.
* I hope this summary helps you make improvements to your codebase.
