** Requirements:

Public users will be able to view, filter, and search events on the calendar.
Authorized organizers will have the ability to add, update, and delete their own events, but cannot modify events created by other organizers.
New locations can be added by the organizer to provide event locations.
Calendar events have a predefined set of 15 tags that the event organizer places on the events. Dates, locations, cost, and recurrence are all part of an event.
These tags can be used to color and highlight the calendar as well as provide filters.
Simple and easy-to-use interfaces for both the website and mobile app.
Free or low-cost technology choices.
Support for filtering capabilities in the SPA and mobile app.
Voice integration with Alexa.
Suitable hosting for a small-scale application with 50-100 users per day, primarily during East Coast daytime hours.

** Use Cases:

Users will access the SPA to view, filter, and search the available calendar events.
Approved and authorized users can add, update, and delete events on the calendar.
Users will use the mobile app to access the calendar, receive notifications for new events, and apply filters.
Users will interact with the calendar application through voice commands on Alexa-enabled devices.


** Technology/Platform Decisions:

Front-end: React for building the SPA.
Back-end: Strapi as the headless CMS for managing content and calendar events.
Calendar Library: FullCalendar for displaying and managing calendar events in the SPA.
Database: SQLite as the lightweight, serverless, and self-contained database for storing calendar events and other content.
Hosting: Heroku as the cloud hosting provider for your application, with the free tier sufficient for your usage scenario.
Mobile App: React Native for building a cross-platform mobile app that works on both iOS and Android devices. (To be implemented in a later version)
Voice Integration: Alexa Skills Kit (ASK) for creating an Alexa Skill, with Rasa as the natural language understanding and processing framework. (To be implemented in a later version)
Note that the mobile app and voice integration will be implemented in later versions of the application.
